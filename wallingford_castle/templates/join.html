        <h2>Join the club</h2>
        <p>
        Wallingford Castle Archers is an active club with around 150 members.
        We cater for all archers - whether you are 6 or 106, a complete
        beginner or an olympic athlete.
        </p>
        <p>
        We shoot all through the year with some shooting taking place almost
        every day of the year. In the outdoor season, serious archers can also
        access 24 hour shooting facilities.
        </p>
        <h3>Coaching</h3>
        <p>
        We run a wide range of group coaching programs for archers of all ages
        and levels. We run groups for novices, intermediates and performance
        adults, as well as two levels of junior groups and minis sessions. For
        most groups we run sessions on two different days in the week to
        maximise availability for everyone, although archers typically only
        attend one.
        </p>
        <p>
        Adult coaching groups are £25/month and junior coaching groups are
        £20/month, both paid monthly with membership. Minis sessions are
        £4/week and are booked in blocks by term.
