        <h2>Join the club</h2>
        <p>
        Wallingford Castle Archers is an active club with around 150 members.
        We cater for all archers - whether you are 6 or 106, a complete
        beginner or an olympic athlete.
        </p>
        <p>
        We shoot all through the year with some shooting taking place at least
        5 days a week.
        </p>
        <h3>Coaching</h3>
        <p>
        We run a wide range of group coaching programs for archers of all ages
        and levels. We run groups for novices, intermediates and performance
        adults, as well as several levels of junior groups, and minis sessions.
        For most groups we run sessions on at least two different days in the
        week to maximise availability for everyone, although archers typically
        only attend one.
        </p>
        <p>
        Adult coaching groups are £30/month and junior coaching groups are
        £25/month, both paid monthly with membership. We also have more
        advanced junior groups which meet more regularly for those who wish to
        take competitive archery seriously. Minis sessions are £5/week and are
        booked in blocks by term.
