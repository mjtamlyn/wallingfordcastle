        <h2>Join the club</h2>
        <p>
        Wallingford Castle Archers is an active club with over 80 members. We
        cater for all archers - whether you are 6 or 106, a complete beginner
        or an olympic athlete.
        </p>
        <p>
        We shoot all through the year with two sessions a week during the
        indoor season and three club sessions during the outdoor season. In the
        outdoor season, serious archers can also access 24 hour shooting
        facilities.
        </p>
        <h3>Coaching</h3>
        <p>
        We run regular boost courses for intermediate archers - ideal to
        develop your skills beyond what you learn on your beginners course.
        </p>
        <p>
        All junior sessions are supported by qualified coaches, and minis
        sessions are led by a qualified coach.
        </p>
        <p>
        Tailored individual coaching programs are available to all club members
        and visiting archers.
