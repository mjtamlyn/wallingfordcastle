        <p>
        We are a club based in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, with a focus on promoting a
        friendly club with a competitive edge. As well as running regular beginners
        courses for both adults and children, our members compete regularly on a club,
        county and national level. Archery is a highly inclusive sport, with juniors
        able to learn along side grandparents, and able bodied alongside disabled.
