        <h2>Junior archers</h2>
        <p>
        Wallingford Castle Archers are proud to be the largest junior club in
        Oxfordshire, and pride ourselves on our family friendly atmosphere. As
        a Young People specialist club, we aim to provide structured
        environments suitable to young archers aged 6-18, with plenty
        opportunities to progress their skills, compete, and enjoy their
        archery.
        </p>
        <h2>Junior archers aged 11-18</h2>
        <p>
        Young people attending secondary school form our junior club. We have a
        dedicated weekly session for archers of this age, covering novices up
        to archers competing at national level. Junior members are also able to
        shoot at other club sessions, although parental supervision is required
        for some sessions. We have many family groups who shoot together.
        </p>
        <p>
        Junior members of Wallingford Castle Archers are encouraged to gain
        competitive experience, through our membership of the Castle Junior
        Archery League, Perris Indoor League, and other local competitions. Our
        coaching team are also heavily involved with the county junior
        development squad.
        </p>
        <p>
        To get started in archery, archers of this age should attend a <a
        href="{% url 'beginners:index' %}">beginners course</a> first.

        <h2>Minis - ages 6-11</h2>
        <p>
        Young people of primary school age form our minis club. We meet on a
        Sunday mornings in term time, and also put on additional sessions over
        the summer holidays. All sessions are structured and led by qualified
        coaches specialising in young people. We run two sessions of 45 minutes
        and each session is split into groups based on age and ability. Minis
        sessions are bookable on a term by term basis, and carry a charge of £6
        per session for non-members and £3 per session for members.
        </p>
        <p>
        Minis wishing to start archery can book their first term as
        non-members. For insurance reasons, once you have attended a certain
        number of hours (usually one term) you must join as a member of the
        club, which includes membership of ArcheryGB.
        </p>
        <p>
        The intense nature of beginners courses makes them unsuitable for our
        youngest archers, and they take longer to progress to independent
        proficiency in core skills such as range safety, set up, warm ups and
        core technique. The environment of open sessions can also prove
        distracting and disruptive for young children. As such, juniors under
        year 5 may only attend minis sessions and occasional other events as
        organised by the club. Once archers are in year 5 or 6, and have
        achieved their World Archery White Arrow beginners award, they may also
        attend junior sessions and open sessions with parental supervision.
        We've found this can be a great way for members in year 6 to prepare
        for secondary school.
