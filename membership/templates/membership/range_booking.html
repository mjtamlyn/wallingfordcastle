<h2>Range bookings</h2>
<div id="app-range-booking"></div>
<p>
    To book a session, select an upcoming club day and find an available slot. You can then select the archer(s) who will be attending.
</p>
<p>
    Unless you have been told otherwise, you may not shoot if you are the only person on the range. Feel free to book a slot when no one else is shooting yet, but be aware it may be cancelled on the day if no one else is shooting at that time.
</p>
<p>
    Junior Archers who have achieved their white arrow award and have their own equipment may attend open shooting slots, but they need to have only one non-shooting family member present on the range, who must wear a face covering at all times. Junior members can also be supervised by a coach or shooting parent. Please note parents are still not allowed to attend junior group sessions.
