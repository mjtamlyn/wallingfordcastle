        <h2>Learn to shoot</h2>
        <p>
        We run regular beginners courses through the year. It's the ideal
        introduction to the sport, teaching you all the basics including how to
        set up, shoot the bow and score your arrows.
        </p>
        <p>
        Beginners courses include six hours of small group tuition over 3 or 4
        sessions. All equipment and coaching will be provided, and at the end
        of the course you will be given a short assessment, just to make sure
        you've taken what we've taught you. After this you will be able to join
        any other open archery club in the country. The course, including hire
        of bows etc. for all sessions will cost £50 for adults and £30 for
        juniors.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you would like to sign up for the next beginners course, please fill
        in the form below. The course have limited numbers due to the size of
        the hall and availability of targets, and places will be allocated on a
        first come first served basis where possible. Payment is accepted
        online before the course, or by cash or cheque (payable to Wallingford
        Castle Archers) at the first session.
