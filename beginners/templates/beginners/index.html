        <h2>Beginners courses</h2>
        <p>
        We run regular beginners courses through the year. It's the ideal
        introduction to the sport, teaching you all the basics including how to
        set up, shoot the bow and score your arrows.
        </p>
        <p>
        Beginners courses include eight hours of small group tuition over 4
        sessions. All equipment and coaching will be provided, and at the end
        of the course you will be given a short assessment, just to make sure
        you've taken what we've taught you. After this you will be able to join
        any other open archery club in the country. The course, including hire
        of bows etc. for all sessions will cost £80 for adults and £50 for
        juniors.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you would like to sign up for the next beginners course, please fill
        in the form below. The course have limited numbers due to the size of
        the hall and availability of targets, and places will be allocated on a
        first come first served basis where possible. Payment is accepted
        online before the course, or by cash or cheque (payable to Wallingford
        Castle Archers) at the first session.
        </p>
        <h3>Young archers</h3>
        <p>
        Beginners courses provide a good grounding for young archers attending
        secondary school, but for those of primary school age we find they are
        too intensive. Young people aged 6-11 should join the <a
        href="{% url 'juniors' %}">minis club</a> first.
        </p>
        <p>
        Unforunately we are not currently taking on beginners of primary school
        age, as we find they need close coaching support when first starting
        which we can't manage under social distancing.

        <h3>Fast track courses</h3>
        <p>
        We are also able to offer one to one, fast track courses. These courses
        are arranged around your schedule as much as possible, and are ideal
        for people with limited availability. Fast track courses cost £160,
        with discounts available for small groups and juniors.

        <h3>COVID-19</h3>
        <p>
        Our courses are now running under social distancing, following guidance
        from Archery GB and the UK Government. We have extended the duration of
        the course and reduced the group sizing from previous years in order to
        ensure that everyone still gets a good experience and has the time and
        space to learn properly. This has required an increase in fees.
        </p>
        <p>
        We have a number of measures in place to ensure that the risk of viral
        transmission is managed, including cleaning and quarantine of shared
        equipment, increased spacing between participants and coaches, and
        minimising the group sizes. If you have any questions, please do ask
        us.
